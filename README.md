# Barriers-and-Dining-Philosophers-Problem-Using-Java-threads
In this project, you are going to use Java threads and semaphores to implement a solution for a modiÔ¨Åed version of famous Dining Philosophers  problem. The description  of  the  famous Dining Philosophers problem is available in course slides. In addition to the Dining Philosophers problem, you will implement a barrier for philosophers, so that they can wait each other before they start dining. You will make use of a GUI class (provided to you) to visualize your solution.
