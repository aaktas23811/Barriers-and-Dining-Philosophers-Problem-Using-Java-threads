# Barriers-and-Dining-Philosophers-Problem-Using-Java-threads
In this project, I used Java threads and semaphores to implement a solution for a modiÔ¨Åed version of famous Dining Philosophers  problem. The description  of  the  famous Dining Philosophers problem is available online. In addition to the Dining Philosophers problem, I implemented a barrier for philosophers, so that they can wait each other before they start dining. I made use of a GUI class (provided to you) to visualize my solution.
